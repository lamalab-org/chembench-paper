Initial visual inspection was followed by dry heating in a Bunsen burner flame, which resulted in the release of hydrate water without sublimate formation; the substance melted with prolonged heating. Solubility tests showed the powder dissolved completely in water, while hard chunks clouded it; this cloudiness disappeared upon adding \pu{2 M} \ce{HCl}. Flame tests produced a brick-red coloration with spectroscopic analysis revealing intense lines at \pu{650 nm} and \pu{550 nm}, and occasional blue/violet lines. \ce{NaOH} produced a precipitate; \ce{Na2HPO4} and soda both formed precipitates in supernatant of \ce{NaOH}-treated solution. \ce{HCl} acidic solution of the sample showed no precipitation with \pu{0.1 M} \ce{HClO4} or tartaric acid/Na-acetate. The \ce{HCl}-acidic solution of hard chunks precipitated with oxalate. No reaction occurred with titan yellow. Potassium tetraphenylborate produced no precipitate. A chromate-rhodizonate test resulted in a brownish-red coloration that disappeared completely with dilute \ce{HCl}. Anion tests were performed on both the original sample and soda extract. The sample showed strong gas evolution with dilute \ce{HCl}, red coloration around zinc granules with Lunge's reagent, no reaction with \ce{BaCl2}, and precipitation with \ce{AgNO3}. The soda extract exhibited similar results except for the gas evolution test. Hard chunks also produced strong gas evolution with dilute \ce{HCl}. The separation procedure involved making the solution alkaline with \pu{2 M} \ce{NH3}, adding \ce{(NH4)2CO3}, and heating in a water bath, which produced a precipitate.
