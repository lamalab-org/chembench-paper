This is because ionized drugs are less able to cross membranes, so making heroin more acidic will increase the proportion of unionized heroin, which can cross membranes more easily. Additionally, absorption of heroin can be increased by encapsulating it in liposomes (option C). Liposomes are small vesicles made of lipids that can fuse with cell membranes and deliver their contents into the cell. This can help to protect heroin from degradation and increase its absorption. Cocaine, on the other hand, is a base and is less likely to be affected by changes in acidity. Therefore, option B is not correct. Option D is also not correct because absorption of heroin can be increased by making it more acidic or by encapsulating it in liposomes."

The formula for Henry's law is:\n\nc = k \u00d7 P\n\nwhere c is the concentration of the gas in the solution, k is the Henry's law constant, and P is the partial pressure of the gas above the solution.\n\nIn this case, we are given the Henry's law constant for CO2 (k = 0.033 mol dm^-3 atm^-1) and the partial pressure of CO2 gas in the can of fizzy drink (P = 3 atm). However, the volume of the can is given in cubic centimeters (250 cm^3), so we need to convert this to cubic decimeters (dm^3) to use the given Henry's law constant. We know that 1 dm^3 = 1000 cm^3, so:\n\n250 cm^3 = 0.25 dm^3\n\nNow we can use Henry's law to find the concentration of CO2 in the fizzy drink:\n\nc = k \u00d7 P\nc = 0.033 mol dm^-3 atm^-1 \u00d7 3 atm\nc = 0.099 mol dm^-3\n\nTherefore, the concentration of CO2 in the fizzy drink is [ANSWER]0.099 mol dm^{-3}[/ANswer]."

      "completion": "[ANSWER]87, 45[/ANSWER] The McLafferty rearrangement in the mass spectrum of ethyl propanoate can lead to two major fragment ions. The first one is formed by the rearrangement of a hydrogen atom from the ethyl group to the carbonyl group, followed by cleavage of the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon atom. This results in a C2H3O2+ ion with an m/z value of 45. The second fragment ion is formed due to the \u03b1-cleavage, where a bond between the carbonyl carbon and the \u03b1-carbon atom breaks, resulting in a C3H5O+ ion with an m/z value of 57. However, the question asks for the m/z value due to McLafferty rearrangement/fragmentation, which is 45. Additionally, there is a possibility of losing a water molecule from the C3H5O+ ion, resulting in a C3H3O+ ion with an m/z value of 45. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[ANSWER]87, 45[/ANSWER]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. McLafferty rearrangement in ethyl propanoate forms a C2H3O2+ ion with an m/z value of 45.\n2. \u03b1-cleavage forms a C3H5O+ ion with an m/z value of 57, which can further lose a water molecule to form a C3H3O+ ion with an m/z value of 45.\n3. Therefore, the m/z values due to McLafferty rearrangement/fragmentation are 45 and 87 (from the molecular ion peak)."

A gold atom at a corner is shared among 8 adjacent unit cells, so each unit cell contains 1/8 of a gold atom at each corner.\n2. A gold atom at the center of a face is shared among 2 adjacent unit cells, so each unit cell contains 1/2 of a gold atom at each face center.\n3. A cubic unit cell has 8 corners and 6 face centers.\n\nSo, the total contribution of gold atoms to the unit cell is:\n(8 corners * 1/8 gold atom per corner) + (6 face centers * 1/2 gold atom per face center) = 1 gold atom\n\nThe volume occupied by a gold atom is equal to the volume of the unit cell divided by the number of gold atoms in the unit cell. Therefore, the fraction of the volume of the unit cell occupied by gold atoms is:\n\nGold atom volume / Unit cell volume = 1 (gold atom) / 1 (unit cell) = 1\n\n[/ANswer]"

The presence of an amide bond might indicate oral availability, as it is a common feature in many oral drugs. However, the cyclic structure might lead to issues with oral absorption, as it can be difficult for the body to break down and absorb large rings.\n\nOption B: C[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCO1)C(=O)N1CCN(CCCOc2ccc(-c3noc(-c4ccccc4)n3)c(F)c2)CC1\nThis structure is larger and more complex than option A, containing multiple rings, a fluorine atom, and a possible amide bond. The presence of multiple rings and a fluorine atom might make it more difficult for the body to absorb and metabolize. However, the presence of an amide bond and a smaller number of rotatable bonds could potentially make it more orally available.\n\nConsidering these simple aspects, neither option appears to be a clear favorite. Further information, such as biological activity and toxicity, would be needed to make a more informed decision.\n\n[ANSWER] Neither A nor B [/ANSWER]"

However, some of the silver ions (Ag+) will form a complex with ammonia (NH3) and become soluble. The solubility of silver chloride is given by the solubility product constant (Ksp), and the formation of the silver amine complex is given by the formation constant (Kf). By using these constants and the given concentrations, we can calculate the amount of silver nitrate that reacts with sodium chloride and forms the silver amine complex.
