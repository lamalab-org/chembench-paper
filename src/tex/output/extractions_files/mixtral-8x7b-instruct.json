The chemical formula for octane is C8H18, and the balanced combustion reaction is:\n\nC8H18 + 12.5 O2 \u2192 8 CO2 + 9 H2O\n\nNow, let's calculate the bond enthalpy change for each type of bond broken and formed during the reaction.\n\nBonds broken:\n- 8 C-C bonds: 8 * 347 kJ/mol = 2776 kJ/mol\n- 18 C-H bonds: 18 * 413 kJ/mol = 7434 kJ/mol\n\nBonds formed:\n- 16 C=O bonds: 16 * 805 kJ/mol = 12880 kJ/mol\n- 18 O-H bonds: 18 * 464 kJ/mol = 8352 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy of combustion by subtracting the energy required to break the bonds from the energy released when forming the new bonds:\n\n\u0394Hcombustion = (12880 + 8352) - (2776 + 7434) = 21232 - 10210 = 11022 kJ/mol\n\n[ANSWER]11022[/ANswer]"

      "completion": "[ANSWER]Zn[/ANSWER] To solve this problem, we first need to determine the mass of the actual H2SO4 in the solution, which is 8.91g * 66% = 5.91g. From the balanced chemical equation, we can see that the molar ratio of H2SO4 to X is 1:1. Therefore, the mass of X that reacts with 5.91g of H2SO4 is also 5.91g.\n\nThe molar mass of Zn is 65.38g/mol, so the moles of Zn are 5.91g / 65.38g/mol = 0.0903 mol. The molar mass of XSO4 is (1*x + 32.07 + 4*16) g/mol, where x is the atomic mass of X. Since the molar mass of XSO4 is twice the molar mass of X, the molar mass of X is half of the molar mass of XSO4, or (molar mass of XSO4) / 2.\n\nThe molar mass of A is (x + 2*16) g/mol, where x is the atomic mass of X. Since the molar mass of A is 50% sulfur, the molar mass of A is (2*x + 32) g/mol / 2 = x + 16 g/mol.\n\nThe molar mass of B is (2*1 + 16) g/mol = 18 g/mol.\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we can see that the molar mass of XSO4 + A + B is equal to the molar mass of H2SO4 + X + A + B. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(molar mass of XSO4) / 2 + x + 16 = molar mass of H2SO4 + x + (molar mass of B)\n\nSubstituting the molar masses we calculated above, we get:\n\n(molar mass of XSO4) / 2 + x + 16 = 98 + x + 18\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(molar mass of XSO4) / 2 = 80\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of XSO4 is 160 g/mol. Since the molar mass of XSO4 is twice the molar mass of X, the molar mass of X is 80 g/mol.\n\nThe only metal with a molar mass of 80 g/mol is Zn, so the symbol of metal X is Zn."

This stereochemical difference will result in different chemical environments for nearby protons, leading to different 1H NMR spectra.\n\nThe NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement SpectroscopY) experiment can also be used to distinguish the two molecules. This experiment can provide information about the spatial proximity of nuclei, which can be used to infer stereochemistry. In this case, the NOESY experiment can potentially detect correlations between protons that are in close proximity due to the different stereochemistry at the carbon atom shared by the two double-bonded oxygen and carbon atoms."

The hydrate water release without sublimate formation, melting with prolonged heating, and complete dissolution in water are characteristic of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide. The brick-red coloration in the flame test, intense lines at 650 nm and 550 nm, and occasional blue/violet lines indicate the presence of magnesium.\n\nThe precipitate formation with NaOH, Na2HPO4, and soda, as well as the red coloration around zinc granules with Lunge's reagent, further support the presence of magnesium. The lack of reaction with BaCl2, K2CrO4 in non-ammoniacal solution, and titan yellow, and the positive chromate-rhodizonate test, are consistent with magnesium.\n\nThe gas evolution with dilute HCl, precipitation with AgNO3, and the similar results for hard chunks, confirm the presence of magnesium ions in the sample."

We can use the molar mass of MCO3 (62.01 + 12.01 + 3 x atomic mass of M) to find the mass of MCO3:\n\nmass of MCO3 = 0.0087 mol x molar mass of MCO3\nmass of MCO3 = 0.0087 mol x (62.01 g/mol + 12.01 g/mol + 3 x atomic mass of M)\n\nWe know that the mass of MCO3 was 1.000 g, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n1.000 g = 0.0087 mol x (62.01 g/mol + 12.01 g/mol + 3 x atomic mass of M)\n\nSolving for the atomic mass of M, we get:\n\natomic mass of M = (1.000 g - 0.0087 mol x 62.01 g/mol - 0.0087 mol x 12.01 g/mol) / (3 x 0.0087 mol)\natomic mass of M = (1.000 g - 0.541 g) / (3 x 0.0087 mol)\natomic mass of M = 0.118 g / (3 x 0.0087 mol)\natomic mass of M = 4.76 g/mol\n\nThe closest match to this atomic mass among the options is Manganese (Mn), which has an atomic mass of 54.94 g/mol.

We do this by multiplying the total mass of the solution by the mass fraction of K2SO4:\n\n500 g * 6% = 30 g of K2SO4\n\nWe want to double this mass to 60 g. The compound (K2SO4.Cr2(SO4)3.24H2O) contains 1 mole of K2SO4 for every mole of the compound. Therefore, we need to find the mass of the compound that contains 30 g of K2SO4 and then double it to get the mass needed to double the K2SO4 concentration.\n\nThe molar mass of K2SO4 is 174 g/mol.
