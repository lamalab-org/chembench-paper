The UK government guidance states: \"The authorised dose regimen for N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in paracetamol overdose is 3 consecutive bags given intravenously over 21 hours.\"\n\n2. The Emergency Care Institute mentions: \"Standard treatment is now a two\u2010bag acetylcysteine IV infusion regime over 20 hours.\"\n\n3. Multiple medical sources, including clinical guidelines and research papers, consistently refer to intravenous N-acetylcysteine as the treatment of choice for paracetamol overdose.\n\nThe other options listed in the question are not recommended treatments for paracetamol overdose to prevent liver necrosis. Intravenous administration of N-acetylcysteine is the most effective and widely accepted treatment in this scenario."

Using plane waves to model this implies using the same precision for empty space as for the occupied one, which is inefficient.\n\nThis answer is correct because plane wave methods treat all space equally, regardless of whether it's occupied or empty. In MOFs, which have large porous regions, this means that computational resources are being used to model empty space with the same precision as the important structural elements. This leads to inefficiency in the calculations, as significant computational power is spent on regions that don't contribute much to the overall properties of the material."
