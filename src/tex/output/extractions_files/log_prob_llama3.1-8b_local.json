The possible isomers are:\n\n1. n-octane (straight chain)\n2. isooctane (branched chain)\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the combustion reaction of n-octane:\n\nC8H18 + 25/2 O2 -> 8CO2 + 9H2O\n\nThe enthalpy of combustion can be calculated by summing the bond enthalpies of the bonds broken and the bond enthalpies of the bonds formed.\n\nBonds broken:\n- 8 C-H bonds: 8 x 413 kJ/mol = 3314 kJ/mol\n- 9 C-C bonds: 9 x 347 kJ/mol = 3113 kJ/mol\n- 25/2 O2 molecules: 25/2 x 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is a diatomic molecule and its bond enthalpy is not given)\n\nBonds formed:\n- 8 C=O bonds: 8 x 805 kJ/mol = 6440 kJ/mol\n- 9 O-H bonds: 9 x 464 kJ/mol = 4176 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy of combustion is the difference between the enthalpy of bonds broken and the enthalpy of bonds formed:\n\n\u0394H = (8 x 413 + 9 x 347) - (8 x 805 + 9 x 464)\n= (3314 + 3113) - (6440 + 4176)\n= 6427 - 10616\n= -4189 kJ/mol\n\nHowever, the question asks for the enthalpy of combustion of an isomer of octane. Since the enthalpy of combustion of n-octane is calculated, we need to consider if the enthalpy of combustion of isooctane is different.\n\nIsooctane has a more branched structure, which means it has more C-C bonds and fewer C-H bonds compared to n-octane. However, the bond enthalpies of C-C and C-H bonds are not significantly different. Therefore, the enthalpy of combustion of isooctane is expected to be similar to that of n-octane.\n\nHowever, the enthalpy of combustion of isooctane is actually slightly"

However, we need to express the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures (P) to use it in the expression.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the total pressure in the reactor is 1 atm. We can calculate the initial partial pressures of CO, H2, and CO2:\n\nP_CO_initial = 40 mol / (40 mol + 20 mol + 20 mol + 40 mol) = 40/120 = 1/3 atm\nP_H2_initial = 20 mol / (40 mol + 20 mol + 20 mol + 40 mol) = 20/120 = 1/6 atm\nP_CO2_initial = 20 mol / (40 mol + 20 mol + 20 mol + 40 mol) = 20/120 = 1/6 atm\nP_H2O = 40 mol / (40 mol + 20 mol + 20 mol + 40 mol) = 40/120 = 1/3 atm\n\nSince the reaction involves the formation of CO2 and H2 from CO and H2O, we can assume that the partial pressures of CO and H2O will decrease, while the partial pressures of CO2 and H2 will increase.\n\nLet x be the number of moles of CO that react to form CO2. Then, the number of moles of CO2 formed is also x. The number of moles of H2 formed is also x.\n\nThe new partial pressures at equilibrium are:\n\nP_CO = (40 - x) / (40 + 20 + 20 + 40 - x) = (40 - x) / (100 - x)\nP_H2 = (20 + x) / (100 - x)\nP_CO2 = (20 + x) / (100 - x)\nP_H2O = (40 - x) / (100 - x)\n\nWe can now substitute these expressions into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\n0.64 = ((20 + x) / (100 - x)) * ((40 - x) / (100 - x)) / ((40 - x)"

The electronic configuration given is [Xe] 4f^{14} 5d^{x} 6s^{2}. \n\nThe electronic configuration of Xenon (Xe) is [Xe] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^{2} 6p^{6}. \n\nSince the electronic configuration of Iridium starts with [Xe], we can assume that the 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^{2} 6p^{6} part is already filled. \n\nThe remaining electrons in Iridium are 77 - 54 (atomic number of Xenon) = 23. \n\nThe 6s and 6p orbitals are already filled with 2 + 6 = 8 electrons. \n\nSo, the remaining electrons are 23 - 8 = 15. \n\nSince the 5d orbital is being filled, we need to find the number of electrons that can fit in the 5d orbital. \n\nThe 5d orbital can hold a maximum of 10 electrons. \n\nHowever, since the 4f orbital is also being filled, we need to consider the electrons in the 4f orbital as well. \n\nThe 4f orbital can hold a maximum of 14 electrons. \n\nSince the 4f orbital is already filled with 14 electrons, the remaining electrons in the 5d orbital will be 15 - 14 = 1.\n\nHowever, this is not the case, because Iridium has 77 electrons and the 4f orbital is filled with 14 electrons, the 5d orbital must be filled with more than 10 electrons. \n\nThe correct way to find the number of electrons in the 5d orbital is to subtract the electrons in the 6s and 6p orbitals from the remaining electrons. \n\nThe 6s and 6p orbitals are filled with 8 electrons. \n\nThe remaining electrons are 77 - 8 = 69. \n\nThe 4f orbital is filled with 14 electrons. \n\nThe remaining electrons are 69 - 14 = 55. \n\nThe 5d orbital can hold a maximum of 10 electrons. \n\nThe remaining electrons are 55 - 10"
