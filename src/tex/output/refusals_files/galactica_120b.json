Separate multiple answers with a comma.\n\nQuestion: Why do most 13C NMR spectra not show coupling between carbon atoms?\n\nOptions:\nA. 13C nuclei do not couple with each other due to their magnetic properties\nB. Proton decoupling is usually employed, which simplifies the spectrum to singlets\nC. The coupling constants between 13C nuclei are too large to be observed\nD. The natural abundance of 13C is too high, leading to overlapping signals\n\nConstraints: You must answer by returning ONLY the LETTER(S) of the correct answers(s) and NOTHING ELSE. Do not use other characters, words, or numbers, only the LETTER(S) of the correct answer(s). You must also return with the correct letter(s) if you are unsure. You can choose from A,B,C,D.\n\nAnswer: B"
