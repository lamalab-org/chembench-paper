      "completion": "The chemical structures provided are quite complex, and it's difficult to assess their suitability for further development without more information, such as their specific targets, bioactivity, and toxicity. However, based on the given information, I would still need to see the 2D structures or perform a molecular weight calculation to make an informed decision.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot visualize the chemical structures from the linear representations provided. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer this question.\n\n[ANSWER] / [/ANSWER] I am unable to provide a valid answer in this case due to the lack of visualizable 2D structures or additional information."
