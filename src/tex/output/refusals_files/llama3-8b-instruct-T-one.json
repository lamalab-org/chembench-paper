      "completion": "A chemistry question!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The concentration of virus particles is 7.1E6 particles per cm\u00b3.\n2. Each virus particle has approximately 20 spike proteins on its surface.\n3. To find the total number of spike proteins, multiply the concentration of virus particles by the number of spike proteins per particle:\n\n7.1E6 particles/cm\u00b3 \u00d7 20 spike proteins/particle = 1.42E8 spike proteins/cm\u00b3\n4. To convert the concentration from spike proteins per cubic centimeter to moles per decimeter cubed (mol/dm\u00b3), we need to know the mass of one spike protein. Unfortunately, the question doesn't provide this information.\n5. However, we can try to estimate the concentration of spike proteins in terms of their mass. Let's assume an average mass of 5000 g/mol for a spike protein (this is a rough estimate, as the actual mass can vary).\n6. Convert the concentration from spike proteins per cubic centimeter to grams per cubic centimeter:\n\n1.42E8 spike proteins/cm\u00b3 \u00d7 5000 g/mol \u00d7 (1 mol / 6.022E23 particles) \u2248 1.18E-5 g/cm\u00b3\n7. Finally, convert the concentration from grams per cubic centimeter to moles per decimeter cubed (mol/dm\u00b3):\n\n1.18E-5 g/cm\u00b3 \u00d7 (1 dm\u00b3 / 1000 cm\u00b3) \u2248 1.18E-8 mol/dm\u00b3\n\nSo, the concentration of spike proteins is approximately [ANSWER] 1.18E-8 [/ANSWER]."
