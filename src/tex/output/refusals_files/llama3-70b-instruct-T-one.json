      "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to know the molecular weight of a spike protein. Unfortunately, this information is not provided. However, let's assume the molecular weight of a spike protein is approximately 50 kDa (a typical value for a protein of this size). We can then proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, we need to convert the concentration of virus particles from cm^{3} to dm^{3}:\n\n1 dm^{3} = 1000 cm^{3}, so the concentration of virus particles is:\n\n7.1E6 particles/cm^{3} \u00d7 (1 dm^{3}/1000 cm^{3}) = 7100 particles/dm^{3}\n\nEach virus particle has 20 spike proteins, so the concentration of spike proteins is:\n\n7100 particles/dm^{3} \u00d7 20 spike proteins/particle = 142000 spike proteins/dm^{3}\n\nThe molecular weight of a spike protein is 50 kDa = 50000 g/mol. We can then calculate the concentration of spike proteins in mol/dm^{3}:\n\n[SP] = 142000 spike proteins/dm^{3} \u00d7 (1 mol/50000 g) \u00d7 (1 g/142000 spike proteins) = 0.01 mol/dm^{3}\n\n[ANSWER]0.01[/ANSWER]"
