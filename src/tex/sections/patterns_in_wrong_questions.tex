The models seem to not be able to answer questions that require specific knowledge (e.g., safety profile of chemicals) and reasoning (e.g., oxidation number of a specific element, the number of chiral centers in an organic molecule or identifying a symmetry group).

\glspl{llm} also struggles with questions that require numerical outputs. Some of these involve multi-step calculations, which can be challenging for \glspl{llm}.\autocite{zhou2023llm_arithmetics}
